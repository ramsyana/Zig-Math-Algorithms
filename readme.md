## üöÄ Prerequisites

- Zig compiler (latest version recommended)

## üîß Running the Algorithms

To run any algorithm, use the Zig run command followed by the specific algorithm file path. For example:

```shell
zig run src/algorithm/math/prime_checker.zig
```

More information is available in the respective file comment header.
