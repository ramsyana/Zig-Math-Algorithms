## 🚀 Prerequisites
- **Zig Compiler**: 
  - Latest version recommended. Install via:

    ```shell
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://ziglang.org/download/index.json | jq -r '.master.url')"
    ```

## 🔧 Running the Algorithms

To run any algorithm, use the Zig run command followed by the specific algorithm file path and any required arguments. For example:

```shell
zig run src/algorithm/math/prime_checker.zig -- 17
```

More information is available in the respective file comment header.

## 📚 Purpose

This repository provides a collection of mathematical algorithms implemented in Zig, showcasing the language's capabilities and performance. Each module is designed to be easily run and tested, making it a useful resource for learning and experimentation.
